## 1. Dice Rolling Game
**Description:**  
Simulates rolling two dice (with a configurable number of sides — currently set to 8). The program keeps track of how many times the dice have been rolled and stops when the user chooses to quit.

**Key Features:**
- Random dice rolls using `random.randint()`
- Continuous play until the user enters **'n'**
- Roll count tracking

**Concepts Used:**  
- `random` module for dice rolls  
- Loops (`while True`) for repeated gameplay  
- User input handling  
- Counters for tracking number of rolls 

## 🚀 How to Run
